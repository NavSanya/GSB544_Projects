    "# Description\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "This dataset consists of information about properties sold in Ames, Iowa. You may have seen this data before, and you may find examples of it being used elsewhere online. The version in this competition has many of the variables removed, for uniqueness and simplicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data fields\n",
    "Here's a brief description of the variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "SalePrice - the property's sale price in dollars. This is the target variable that you're trying to predict.\n",
    "PID - An identifying number of the property\n",
    "LotFrontage: Linear feet of street connected to property\n",
    "LotArea: Lot size in square feet\n",
    "Street: Type of road access\n",
    "Neighborhood: Physical locations within Ames city limits\n",
    "BldgType: Type of dwelling\n",
    "HouseStyle: Style of dwelling\n",
    "OverallQual: Overall material and finish quality\n",
    "OverallCond: Overall condition rating\n",

    "Heating: Type of heating\n",
    "CentralAir: Central air conditioning\n",
    "Electrical: Electrical system\n",
    "GrLivArea: Above grade (ground) living area square feet\n",

    "HalfBath: Half baths above grade\n",
    "Bedroom AbvGr: Number of bedrooms above basement level\n",
    "TotRmsAbvGrd: Total rooms above grade (does not include bathrooms)\n",
    "Functional: Home functionality rating\n",
    "ScreenPorch: Screen porch area in square feet\n",
    "PoolArea: Pool area in square feet\n",
    "YrSold: Year Sold\n",
    "SaleType: Type of sale\n",
    "\n",
    "## GOAL\n",
    "Your mission today is to use the available variables to predict the sales price of homes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Only your first two submissions will be graded!\n",
    "Acknowledgments\n",
    "The Ames Housing dataset was compiled by Dean De Cock for use in data science education. It's an incredible alternative for data scientists looking for a modernized and expanded version of the often cited Boston Housing dataset."

    "## Evaluation\n",
    "### Goal\n",
    "It is your job to predict the sales price for each house. For each PID in the test set, you must predict the value of the SalePrice variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Submission File Format\n",
    "The file should contain a header and have the following format:\n",
    "\n",
    "PID             SalePrice\n",
    "907135180\t169000.1\n",
    "903206120\t187724.1233\n",
    "etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can download an example submission file (sample_submission.csv) on the Data page.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Metric\n",
    "Submissions are evaluated on Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) between the logarithm of the predicted value and the logarithm of the observed sales price. (Taking logs means that errors in predicting expensive houses and cheap houses will affect the result equally.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that although this metric is calculated on log price, your submitted predictions need to be regular prices."
