    "## DATA SOURCE\n",
    "The board game company Cards Against Humanity (CAH) is known for putting a lot of effort into silly publicity stunts. In 2017, they launched Cards Against Humanity Saves America, a series of politically-related activities. One such activity was a monthly poll, asking some silly questions and some serious questions about the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "To conduct their polls in a scientifically rigorous manner, they partnered with Survey Sampling International — a professional research firm — to contact a nationally representative sample of the American public.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analyses of the data conducted by CAH can be found here: https://thepulseofthenation.com/#poll-12. You are welcome to reference their analyses to help inform your own. Note that some questions from the poll have been omitted for purposes of this exam, and that others have been cleaned or edited so that not all possible responses are included.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please also note that, while the data itself is collected by a rigorous neutral party, the discussion on the CAH website is highly opinionated. I share it for you information, not as an endorsement of their messages.\n",
